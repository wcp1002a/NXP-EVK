## Hello AI World

Hello AI World can be run completely onboard your Jetson, including inferencing with TensorRT and transfer learning with PyTorch.  The inference portion of Hello AI World - which includes coding your own image classification and object detection applications for Python or C++, and live camera demos - can be run on your Jetson in roughly two hours or less, while transfer learning is best left to leave running overnight.

#### System Setup
